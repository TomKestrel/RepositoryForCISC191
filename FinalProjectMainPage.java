 * Next Step to do:
 * Find a way to practice/show implementation of aggregation. Find a way to do that with sliders that I will be adding to the southPanel
 * Then find a way a tier selection will update the slider
 * Question to ask myself: have the tier selection bring a whole new JFrame up, but will it be possible to have the updated slider implemented correctly from one JFrame to next?
